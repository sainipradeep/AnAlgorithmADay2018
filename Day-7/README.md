So this algorithm is to reverse an integer. I feel it's pretty straightforward with just converting the integer to a string and then reversing it and returning it.  The only major issue is dealing with negative values.  we dont want the negative sign to be returned at the end, but rather the front. so in this case i just ignored the original negative sign and just concatenated a new negative sign. i would like to explore better solutions to this as i feel mine is a little primative.
