So this is a pretty simple problem when you use built in methods like join and sorted.  my approach was to sort both string and see if they equaled each other.  another approach would be to add each to a dictionary and see if the dicionaries matched.  it's possible to even iterate over one and compare to the other and pop the values once found. although that seems very long and needless.  

a few questions to ask would be to see if uppercase/lowercase matters.  if it doesn't, it would be good to cast all lower then compare.  for my example i did not.
