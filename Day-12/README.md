So this problem was similar to a previous problem except in this one i want to find the first time there is a duplicate. so in this particular problem, it needs to run in O(n) time and i did this by using a set. i looped through the lst and for each number, checked each number to see if it has already been added to the set. if it has not, then i add it.otherwise,if i find  a duplicate, i return that item.
