wow. so this problem was very easy and i would have failed. it's important to pay attention to the problem's question before just jumping in. I made assumptions and just dived in.  after reading the problem very carefully, i realized to return true, i needed at least ONE value to be equal to 2 or GREATER.  i made quick assumptions because the question was easy and didn't solve it correctly the first time.
