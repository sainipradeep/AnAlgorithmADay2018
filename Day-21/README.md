in this algorithm, we are given two strings.  by either inserted, deleting or replacing, we can make both string equal each other.  to check if this is possible, i concatenated the strings into one and then got the character count in a dictionary.  then i went through just the values and counted all the odd number values.  for this to work, we can't have an odd count higher than 2."
