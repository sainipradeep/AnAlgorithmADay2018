This problem can be solved pretty easily by using python's slice operator. you are given the actual length of the string so you can just clip the remaining character.  one question might me to ask if we can assume to alwayys clip the remaining on the end or if it's possible for it to be at the beginning.  after that you just use the .replace method to replace all empty characters with the string '20%' and then return
