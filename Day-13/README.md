This problem needed to be in solved in O(n) time. my main plan was to iterate through the string and check if that character is uppercase. if it is, then i added a space and then concatenated the character which i changed to be lowercase to a new string. otherwise i just concatenated the character untouched  now this would potentially cause an empty white space at the very beginning of the string so i stripped the result string.
