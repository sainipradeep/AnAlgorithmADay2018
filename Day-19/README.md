This solution used the python try and except.  it helps with runtime by elimating extra if/else while loops. in this, we set a head and pointer and the pointer runs twice as fast as the head. if there is a loop, then as some point, the head and pointer will be at the same node and will return true that there is a loop.  that's in the try.  if the fast pointer ends up eaching the end, the it will return false."
